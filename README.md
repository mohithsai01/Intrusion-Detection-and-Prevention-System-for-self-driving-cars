Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS)
ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project focuses on building an Intelligent Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDPS) tailored for self-driving vehicles and networked environments. Unlike traditional rule-based models, this system leverages deep learning techniques (CNN + Attention + RBF) to detect both known and zero-day attacks in real time, providing adaptive cybersecurity for intelligent transportation systems.

ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

         Develop a deep learning-based IDPS optimized for vehicular networks.
         Improve detection accuracy while reducing false positives.
         Enable real-time detection and prevention with low latency.
         Enhance public trust and safety in autonomous driving systems.

âš™ Experimental Setup

      Hardware: Intel Core i7 (10th Gen), 16 GB RAM, 512 GB SSD
      Software: Python 3.10, TensorFlow 2.x, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn
      Dataset: Vehicular telemetry & network logs (CSV format)
      Training: Federated learning setup with local client updates
      Validation: Train-test split & k-fold cross-validation

ðŸ“Š Evaluation Metrics

     Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)
     Precision = TP / (TP + FP)
     Recall (Detection Rate) = TP / (TP + FN)
     F1-Score = Harmonic mean of Precision & Recall
     False Positive Rate (FPR) = FP / (FP + TN)

ðŸš€ Results

Accuracy: 83.84%
Precision: 83.25%
Recall: 83.84%
F1-score: 83.54%
RÂ² Score: ~0.96 (high generalization ability)
